Tech:
FrontEnd: We used html programming language to create entires and input data's. We connected .html files with .php file for backend.
BackEnd: We used php programming language to program update, delete, insert and display queries. We use XAMPP: an open-source cross-platform web-server to connect php with database.
Database: We used MySQL to store dataset. We used SQL as a primary programming language. 

Designed for: CSE3330-001 DATABASE SYSTEMS AND FILE STRUCTURES.

HOW to RUN:
- Localhost/ProjectName/file.html
Eg: localhost/DOCTOR/update.html

Input data on webpage.
Check for results in the PhpMyAdmin database

What to AVOID:
- Check the network and server connection.
- check the database name.
- check the queries name.
- check for correct values and relations.
- check for primary key, foreign key as constraints.
- check for the dataset. If there is no dataset in database, insert new data using SQL language.
